In our board features file you can see our initial conditions set for the tic tac toe program and how we went about in creating it. The main program being built around these conditions and having it run by these rules.

In our Graph pdf you can see all of our graph outcomes for the different games played by our program and see how the outcome was overall. Seeing a line graph of seeing the win vs lose ratio plays out over time.

In our Main python file "main.py" this is our main code for the tic tac toe game. 

To run this file you need to do "cd.main.py" 

When looking at our main code you can see that we start off by setting up our global variables and initialize the lists to store our wins, loses, and tie rate. Then we started creating our features for V train and determineing the value of the board features for program to run efficiently. Being able to determine the taken and empty positions on the board and from there letting the program do its thing. Then writing the code for showing how the game will be played out and how the match will occur. We created a class AI for the computer to self learn and being able to create a new value for each weight. With it then playing out and over time training to become more efficient. You can see this after running our program and after playing more tries you can see the win to lose ratio improve.
